# The rules of the game.
The rules of the game is that you have to avoid oncoming traffic to get to the finish line to go to the next level

# Process for turning the game into a web application 
I first started by creating a wireframe of my game. I then proceeded to get an image of the user car and made sure it was movable on the screen using the arrow keys. After this step was complete retrieved an obstacle image online and started animating it accross the screen. I did some collision detection to stop the obstacle once the car was hit. I repeated this step for multiple obstacles and my game started coming together. Issues that I came accross was having multiple objects independently moving on the page and stopping all of them once the user hit any of them. Resetting the game board to it's original state and adding sounds with the animations was also a challenge. It was a fun experience and I definitely want to add more features to the game.
